# AmbientDJ MIDI in configuration file for Mixtrack Pro II
# This is a simple file format:
# <note number>,<label>
# This is, obviously, a comment.
#
# labels are case sensitive and must be correct as they are
# used internally as 'send' destinations. Leading and trailing
# spaces will be removed.
#
# + in front of a name will initialise the value at startup
# (internal hack, don't worry about it. Itâ€™s needed for the Play buttons)

# The File lamp shares a MIDI note number with the LoadA button
# and my loader can't cope with that. Luckily we don't
