# Ambient DJ
Max Ambient DJ program for using DJ decks for sampling purposes.

Ths program requires Max 7 (runtime will do) and some form of DJ MIDI controller decks, 
I use the Numark Mixtrack Pro II.

The GUI is for show and reference only - this software WILL NOT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HARDWARE - all of the
functions are controlled from the DJ Decks.

Currently only the Mixtrack Pro II is supported and must be named in the preferences screen (button at the top right of the screen). If you want to use another Deck device then you will need to work out what MIDI codes each 
button, slider, and the decks send and edit the files data/ambientdj-cc.txt (for MIDI CCs) and 
data/ambientdj-notes.txt (for MIDI notes). If you need help in this then email me.

If you do sucessfully port those files to another device then *please* send me the files so I can include them
in future releases.

I wrote a blog post about the software here:
